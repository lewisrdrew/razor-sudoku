# Razor Sudoku
Razor Sudoku is a Sudoku game created using a .NET Razor Page with JavaScript validation.
Most of the logic for the generation of the grid and the validation of the answers was copied over from a Java version of Sudoku written in 2018 (https://github.com/lewisrdrew/sudoku) and may need to be refactored.
